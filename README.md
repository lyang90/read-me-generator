# ReadMe Generator

## Description

This project create a professional readME for projects given the project's information as input. While creating this project I learned to write to files using NodeJS and also becoming more familiar with NodeJS. The project was created to help me understand how to use NodeJS and be able to use the various different functions NodeJS has.


## Installation

To install this project, you can simply download the code from github or clone the repo to be able to use the readMe generator.

  
## Usage

To acutally run this project you should use NodeJS to run the javascript file. By doing so, prompts will appear which will ask for the project's information and you call fill those out to get a the readMe generated. Also, note that not all the licenses on Github were included in this readMe generator in the cause the user cannot find the right license. The file will be created and you can use that as your readMe for your project.
